                Charge Controller
            </h2>

            <p>
                A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery bank from the solar array. It ensures
                that the deep cycle batteries are not overcharged during the day, and that the power doesn’t run
                backwards to the solar panels overnight and drain the batteries. Some charge controllers are available
                with additional capabilities, like lighting and load control, but managing the power is its primary job
            </p>

            <p>
                A solar charge controller is available in two different technologies, PWM and MPPT. How they perform in
                a system is very different from each other.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Solar energy begins with the sun. Solar panels (also known as "PV panels") are used to convert light
                from the sun, which is composed of particles of energy called "photons", into electricity that can be
                used to power electrical loads.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solar panels can be used for a wide variety of applications including remote power systems for cabins,
                telecommunications equipment, remote sensing, and of course for the production of electricity by
                residential and commercial solar electric systems.

                Inverter
            </h2>
            <p>
                A power inverter, or inverter, is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current
                (DC) to alternating current
            </p>
            <p>
                The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of the
                specific device or circuitry. The inverter does not produce any power; the power is provided by the DC
                source.
            </p>
            <p>
                A power inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects (such as a
                rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry. Static inverters do not use moving parts in the conversion
                process.

                Advanced battery systems designed, engineered and manufactured for a range of cordless applications
                including e-bikes, power tools, home appliances and more.
                A battery management system (BMS) is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery (cell or
                battery pack), such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating
                area[clarification needed], monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data,
                controlling its environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Battery systems are quite complex and become more complex when developed into high voltage designs that
                are further subjected to the broad environmental extremes seen in transportation.

                AC power
            </h2>
            <p>
                Alternating current (AC) power is the standard electricity format that comes out of outlets. The name
                comes from the waveform the current takes. To understand the composition of the AC wave, you need to
                understand that electrical currents come from a flow of electrons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the digital electronics that you build will use DC. However, it is important to understand some
                AC concepts. Most homes are wired for AC, so if you plan to connect your Tardis music box project to an
                outlet, you will need to convert AC to DC.

                DC power

            <p>
                Direct Current (DC) Power refers to the unidirectional flow of electrons and is the form of power that
                is most commonly produced by sources such as solar cells and batteries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Power can be defined as the rate of energy consumed in a unit time. The unit of measurement of power is
                Watt, after the famous eighteenth century scientist, James Watt who invented the steam engine. In
                mechanical systems, power is known as mechanical power and is a combination of forces and movement.
